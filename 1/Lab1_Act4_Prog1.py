#printing an interesting fact about the programmer
print("I've been involved in robotics and that got me interested in coding")
#calculating voltage across a conductor with resistance 20 ohms and current 5 amperes
print("Voltage across the conductor is", (20*5), "volt")
#calculating kinetic energy of an object of mass 100 kg and velocity 21 m/s
print("Kinetic energy of the object is", (0.5*100*(21**2)), "joule")
#calculating reynolds number for a fluid with velocity 100 m/s an kinematic viscosity 1.2 (m^2)/s and linear dimension 2.5 m
print ("Reynolds number for the fluid is",(100*2.5/1.2))
